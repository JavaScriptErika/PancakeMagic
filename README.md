# Pancake Magic

This is fun practice layout page I created in a day - who doesn't love pancakes?

I even implemented Flexbox so that the main pancake image would fill the viewport only (in my two screenshots I scrolled down on my browser to capture all of my elements). 
I was inspired to create the full background image after watching Dev Tips. Centering my content in the middle of the full image background was SO much easier with flexbox, cleaner, and more elegant 
than any methods I have coded before. I cannot wait to dive in and code some creative layouts. 

The main purpose of this mini project is practicing floats (which I used for the columns), and inline-block (for the navigation),
and various layout methods to learn the characteristics of each - thus, my layout techniques are not uniform but that is intentional
for practice. I even used absolute positioning on the down arrow. 

In general, I found it super helpful to understand what was going on by popping borders on my divs - it's a great visual
in the coding and designing process. I also built the page with responsive design in mind, thus mobile first.

I've learned a BIG lesson in responsive design in general. While pages may look great on small screens width wise on your desktop, 
you must ALWAYS take into account the height of your viewport on mobile devices...not just width, and not just depend on the browser 
for how your design will actually display on devices it is trying to imitate. 

After this project, you bet I had some pancakes later that night! By the way, is [Cupcake Ipsum](http://www.cupcakeipsum.com/) not plain awesome or what?
I was probably more excited over text than someone should be. However, I did come up with those snazzy navigation labels, header info,
and headings over the columns!
